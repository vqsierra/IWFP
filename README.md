## Overview

The Indigenous Wholistic Factors Project (IWFP) is a community-engaged, data-driven initiative aimed at advancing culturally grounded understandings of suicide risk and protective factors among Native American youth in California. This repository supports the manuscript:

**"Predicting Suicidal Ideation Among Native American High Schoolers in California"**  

This study uses data from the 2019â€“2020 California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS) and is guided by Indigenous Wholistic Theory and the Indigenous Computational Approach. A LASSO logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of past-year suicidal ideation among Native American high school students.

## Project Goals

- Advance culturally grounded knowledge of risk and protective factors to support suicide prevention among Native American youth in California
- Apply community-centered machine learning methods through the Indigenous Computational Approach to support ethical, culturally responsive public health research
- Promote open science practices that align with Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles

## Software Requirements

Analyses require **Stata/SE 17.0 or higher** and the following user-written packages:

- `lasso2` â€“ Penalized regression
- `cvauroc` â€“ AUC estimation
- `calibrationbelt` â€“ Model calibration assessment
- `moremata` â€“ Matrix and math utilities

Install them in Stata using:

```stata
ssc install lasso2
ssc install cvauroc
ssc install calibrationbelt
ssc install moremata
```

## Data Availability

The California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS) data are **not publicly shared** in this repository due to privacy protections for youth and school districts. Researchers may request access from WestEd or local education authorities under subject of IRB approval.
